## API version and Security

_api_version_ follows URL prefix and defines which version of this API supports current implementation.

Example:


`GET /tango/rest` =>
```JSON
{
    "rc5":"http://hzgcttest:8080/tango/rest/rc5"
}
```

`GET /tango/rest/non_existing_version` => `HTTP 404`

All resources under _api_version_ must be protected and require an authentication (specification allows non-protected resources but this is strictly not recommended).

Implementation SHOULD implement some of the standard [WWW-Authenticate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#Authentication_schemes) types.

For instance, when protected by Basic:

`GET /tango/rest/rc5` =>
```
HTTP OK
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Tango-Controls Realm" 
```
```JSON
{
    "hosts":"/tango/rest/rc5/hosts"
}
```

In case of _Basic_ any unauthorized request to any protected resource under _rest/api_version_ must get _HTTP 401 Not Authorized_ response
and follow the standard Web Basic Authorization mechanism.

__IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:__ consider integration with TangoAccessControl so that each request is validated against it.

## Links

Implementation SHOULD attach a number of links to a particular response. For instance most of the response types may include _self_ link:

```
HTTP response

Link: <link>; rel="self"
```

as well as external relationship links:

`GET /tango/rest/rc5/hosts/localhost`
```
HTTP response

Link: </tango/rest/rc5/hosts>; rel="parent"
```

See [Link header](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988)

Implementation MUST prefer lower case urls in links e.g. `DevString` (command name) -> `devstring`.

## Filters

Any response can be supplied with a filter parameter:

 URL                |   Response  | Desc
------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------
`GET /{any}?filter={fld1}&filter={fld2}&...[filter=!{fld1}&filter=!{fld2}&...]` | Depends on the response type: JSONArray or JSONObject | - response contains only required fields (or inverse)


This one shows only _name_ and _server_ fields;

`GET /devices/sys/tg_test/1?filter=name&filter=server`:
```JSON
{
    "name":"sys/tg_test/1",
    "info":{
        "name":"sys/tg_test/1",
        "server":"TangoTest/test",
    },
    "attributes":[
                    {
                        "name": "string_scalar"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "long_scalar_w"
                    }
                ],
    "commands":[
                   {
                       "name":"DevString"
                   },
                   {
                       "name":"DevLong"
                   }
               ]
}
```

This one shows everything except _info_ and _properties_ fields:

`GET /devices/sys/tg_test/1/attributes?filter=!info&filter=!properties`:
```JSON
[
    {
        "name": "long_scalar_w",
        "value":"<prefix>/devices/sys/tg_test/1/attributes/long_scalar_w/value"
    },
    {
        "name": "string_scalar",
        "value":"<prefix>/devices/sys/tg_test/1/attributes/string_scalar/value"
    }
]
```


## Pages

|  URL           |  Response | Desc
|----------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------
| `GET /{any_collection}?range={range}` | JSONArray | - response contains only required number of resources

For instance, `GET /devices?range=0-25` will display only the first 25 devices of a particular Tango host

The implementation MUST return corresponding HTTP headers:

    HTTP 206 OK
    Content-Range: offset â€“ limit / count
        offset: index of the first element
        limit : index of the last element
        count : total number of elements from the collection
    Accept-Range: resource and max
        resource : type of the element
        max : maximum number of element per request
    Link: can return several URI to the previous and next range, the first and last range ...

## Errors

Any error MUST return status code __400__ (BadRequest). Except few cases: see below.

```JSON
{
    "errors":[
        {       
            "reason":"TangoProxyException",
            "description":"sys/tg_test/1 proxy has throw an exception",
            "severity":"ERR",
            "origin":"DeviceProxy#readAttribute sys/tg_test/1/throwException"
        },
        {       
            "reason":"",
            "description":"",
            "severity":"PANIC",
            "origin":""
        }
    ],   
    "quality": "FAILURE",
    "timestamp": 123456789
}
```

__IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:__ any exception that can be handled on the server side must be handled, i.e. a proper JSONObject must be returned.

### 404

Resource does not exist e.g. `GET devices/x/y/z` should return status code 404 if `x/y/z` is not defined in th Tango db.

### 408

In case tango request failed with CORBA.TIMEOUT exception

### 500

Tango REST server crashes - indicates bug in the REST server

### 503

In case of event subscription REST server returns 503 if upstream server does not respond within specified timeout. May indicate that there is no event though i.e. is not a failure.

__IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:__ server should not log any error except 500 when it is a server's failure.
